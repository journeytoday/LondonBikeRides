## Data Source
The analysis utilizes several data files, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, a Jupyter Notebook for data processing, and the original dataset zip file.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Python**: Used in Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- **Excel**: For initial data organization and manipulation.

## Key Insights
Based on the analysis, here are some potential insights:
- **Peak Usage Times**: Identification of the most active times for bike usage, likely indicating commuting patterns.
- **Popular Routes and Locations**: Analysis of commonly used routes and popular start and end points.
- **Seasonal Variations**: Changes in bike usage with different seasons.
- **User Demographics**: Insights into which demographic groups are more inclined to use bike rides.
- **Impact of Weather**: How various weather conditions affect bike riding habits.
- **Duration and Distance**: Average duration and distance of bike rides.
- **Bike Availability and Turnover**: Utilization efficiency and turnover rate at bike stations.
- **Correlation with Public Events**: Changes in bike ride patterns during public events or holidays.

## How to Use the Dashboard
