# London Bike Rides Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to bike rides in London. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in bike usage across the city, offering insights into user behavior, peak usage times, and popular routes.

## Tableau Dashboard
The project features an interactive Tableau dashboard that presents a comprehensive view of London bike rides. Users can explore various data visualizations to gain insights into the biking habits in London.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes several data files, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, a Jupyter Notebook for data processing, and the original dataset zip file.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Python**: Used in Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- **Excel**: For initial data organization and manipulation.

## Key Insights
Based on the analysis of the `london_bikes_final.xlsx` data, here are some key insights:
- **Peak Usage Times**: The highest bike usage is during typical commuting hours, particularly at 8 AM and 5-6 PM.
- **Day of the Week Analysis**: Higher average bike usage on weekdays, with Thursday being the busiest.
- **Seasonal Trends**: The highest bike usage occurs in summer, followed by autumn, spring, and winter.
- **Holiday Impact**: Lower bike usage on holidays compared to non-holidays.
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Usage**: Weekdays see higher bike usage than weekends.
- **Weather Influence**: Weather conditions significantly impact bike usage, with the highest usage under scattered clouds, followed by broken clouds and clear weather. The least usage is during snowfall.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Navigation**: Explore different views or tabs in the dashboard for varied insights.
2. **Interacting with Charts**: Click on elements, hover to see more details, or use sliders for interactive analysis.
3. **Filtering Data**: Use filters to view specific data subsets, such as by date, time, or weather conditions.
4. **Resetting Views**: Reset the dashboard to its original state after applying filters for a fresh analysis.
5. **Exploring Data Points**: Drill down into more detailed data where available.
6. **Downloading Data/Views**: If available, download data or views from the dashboard for further analysis.
