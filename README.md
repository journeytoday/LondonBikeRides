# London Bike Rides Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to bike rides in London. Using a comprehensive dataset, this work aims to uncover patterns and trends in bike usage across the city, offering insights into peak times, popular routes, and user behavior.

## Tableau Dashboard
The centerpiece of this project is a Tableau dashboard that visually represents the data. This interactive tool allows users to explore various aspects of the bike rides, including geographical patterns and temporal trends.
